# We believe that this error is caused by infrastructure: https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-36685.
value should not start or finish with whitespace ' not(f:kind/@value='instance') or (not(exists(f:implementation)) and exists(f:software))'

# CodeSystem used as an example so need not to be valid
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://example.com/events/syncerror/your-error-code-system' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# FHIRcast has chosen to use the system to indicate the event name - no CodeSystem is defined or required.
%https://fhircast.hl7.org/events/syncerror/%

# As the specification has not been published yet, so the url does not exists
%ImplementationGuide-hl7.fhir.uv.fhircast.html%

# Examples is provided by other profiles that are based on this one.
The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

#this is intentional
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/fhircast/StructureDefinition/fhircast-hub-operation-outcome-syncerrror|3.0.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# informational message is incorrect. Believe that we are using the right canonical url for radlex.  Tx.fhir.org just thinks itâ€™s draft content
Reference to draft CodeSystem http://radlex.org|4.1.0 (from http://tx.fhir.org/r4)

# Informational severity; will investigate appropriate of assigning an OID, but not before ballot
This resource could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)

#Informational severity; looking into THO processes, but not before ballot
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
