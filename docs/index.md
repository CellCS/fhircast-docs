# FHIRcast - _modern, simple application context synchronization_

## What?

FHIRcast synchronizes healthcare applications in real time to show the same clinical content to a common user. For example, a radiologist often works in three disparate applications at the same time (a radiology information system, a PACS and a dictation system), she wants each of these three systems to display the same study or patient at the same time. 

FHIRcast isn't limited to radiology use-cases. Using [FHIR Subscriptions](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/subscription.html), FHIRcast naturally extends the SMART on FHIR launch protocol to achieve tight integration between disparate, full-featured applications. FHIRcast builds on the [CCOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCOW) abstract model to specify an http-based, simple and decentralized context synchronization specification.


## Why?

The large number of vendor-specific or proprietary context synchronization methods in production use limit the industry's ability to enhance the large number of integrations currently in production. In practice, these integrations are decentralized and simple.
